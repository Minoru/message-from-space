Interpretation
--------------

Contributed by Discord user @FiddlesticksMcGee.

Appears to designate a syntax for declaring variables.

Variables have a border of high values framing a negative of numbers as previously encoded in :doc:`radio-transmission-recording`.


Decoded
-------

.. literalinclude:: message8-decoded.txt


Code
----

Revised version of the Haskell code that supports the variable glyphs is published on the :ref:`message #3 page <message3-code>`.

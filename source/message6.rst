Interpretation
--------------

Contributed by Discord user @elventian.

Just like in :doc:`message5`, there are two unknown symbols in this message, together they represent a decrement operation.

The three-pixel symbol is identical to increment operation, and the other complicated one looks similar to increment,
but rejects our theory about internal structure of the symbol, so it's just an arbitrary patterns.


Decoded

Revised version of the Haskell code that supports the ``dec`` glyph is published on the :ref:`message #3 page <message3-code>`.
